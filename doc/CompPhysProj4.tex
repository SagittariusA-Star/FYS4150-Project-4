\begin{abstract}
	We model the time development of a 2D ferromagnetic Ising model using a
	Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the Metropolis algorithm for a lattice of
	$N\times N$ interacting spins with periodic boundaries. Our model behaves in
	good agreement with the known analytical results for a $2\times2$ lattice
	using more than $10^4$ Monte Carlo cycles. When studying a $N=20$ lattice we
	find that it stabilizes around an equilibrium after about $5000$ Monte Carlo
	cycles for temperatures $k_BT/J=1.0$ and $k_BT/J=2.4$ for an ordered and
	disordered initial spin configuration. Our results show that the lattice
	with the lower temperature stabilizes faster than for the higher
	temperature, effectively freezing at equilibrium. This is also reflected by
	the energy distributions around the equilibrium where the higher temperature
	lattice follows a Gaussian distribution while the lower temperature has a
	narrow distribution with a small number of likely energy states. For the
	critical temperature where the system loses its magnetization, we find it to
	be $k_BT_C / J \approx 2.284$, which corresponds to a relative error
	$\epsilon \approx 0.675\%$ compared to the analytical solution by
	\cite{onsager:1944}.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
An ever occuring problem in many fields of science is a binary system of
interacting elements taking two possible values. Binary problems can be found in
everything from political science, where one could model outcomes of a vote in a
two party system, to modeling phase transitions in solid states physics. In this
paper we will focus on the latter, where we will model a time evolving
two-dimensional Ising model of interacting spins by means of a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in addition to a Metropolis algorithm as described
by Ch. 3. and 4. by \cite{newman:2019}. We will explore how
different grid sizes and temperatures make the lattice behave, and how the system's energy and magnetization
develope with time. The final aim being to estimate the critical temperature of
the phase transition when the lattice loses its magnetization, as presented in
Ch. 5. and 6. in \cite{plischke:2006}. This is then
compared to the analytical value found by \cite{onsager:1944}.

This paper will present needed theory and implementation of the theory in the Method
section (\ref{sec:method}), the results will be presented in the Results section
(\ref{sec:results}) and be discussed in the Discussion section
(\ref{sec:discussion}).

\section{Method} \label{sec:method}
\subsection{The Ising Model and Important Quantities from Statistical Menchanics} \label{subsec:ising_model}
The physical system considered by this paper will be a two-dimensional Ising
model, consisting of a grid of $N\times N$ magnetic spins. Each spin can have
the value $s = +1$ or $s = -1$, and they interact only with their nearest neighbors.
The energy of the lattice is defined by the interaction of each neighboring
spin pair as
\begin{align}
	E = -J\sum_l\sum_{\langle kl\rangle} s_k s_l,
	\label{eq:energy}
\end{align}
where $\langle kl\rangle$ denotes the sum over the nearest neighbors and $J$ has units energy. When counting the
energies we choose to use periodic boundaries, meaning that the nearest
neighbor of a spin $s_{i,N-1}$ at the edge of the lattice is the spin $s_{i,0}$
at the opposite edge of the lattice. This is done so as to simulate a lattice
that extends infinitly in space.
The magnetization is defined similarly as
\begin{align}
	M = \sum_i s_i,
	\label{eq:magnetization}
\end{align}
simply being the sum of the systems spins. The probability density function (PDF) of the system having
a cetain energy state is given by the Boltzmann distribution
\begin{align}
	P(E_i) = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta E_i},
\end{align}
where $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$ for the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and the
temperature $T$. The partition function of the system describing all statistical
properties of the system in equilibrium is given as
\begin{align}
	Z = \sum_{i} e^{-\beta E_i},
\end{align}
over all possible microstates ($2^{N^2}$ in total for a $2\times 2$ grid) of the system. The mean energy and absolute magnetization
of the system are then given as
\begin{align}
	\langle E \rangle &= \sum_{i} E_i P(E_i) = \sum_{i} \frac{E_i}{Z}e^{-\beta E_i} = \pdv{\ln Z}{\beta}\\
	\langle |M| \rangle &= \sum_{i} |M_i| P(E_i) = \sum_{i} \frac{|M_i|}{Z}e^{-\beta E_i}
\end{align}
and represent the most likely state of the system.
Another important quantity from
thermodynamics is the heat capacity measuring the change heat for a given
temperature change. The heat capacity at constant volume is given as
\begin{align} 
	C_V &= \dv{\langle E \rangle}{T} = \frac{1}{k_B T^2}\left(\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{i} E_i^2 e^{-\beta E_i} - \langle E\rangle^2\right) \\
	& = \frac{1}{k_BT^2}\left(\langle E^2\rangle - \langle E\rangle^2\right) = \frac{\sigma^2_E}{k_B T^2},
\end{align}
thus being analogous to the variance in energy states.
Finally, the magnetic susceptibility measuring how the systems magnetization
responds to a temperature change, is defined as
\begin{align}
	\chi &= \beta\left(\sum_{i}\frac{M_i^2}{Z}e^{-\beta E_i} - \langle |M_i|\rangle^2 \right)\\
	& = \frac{1}{k_BT}\left(\langle M^2\rangle - \langle |M|\rangle^2\right) = \frac{\sigma^2_{|M|}}{k_BT}.
\end{align}
These thermodynamical quantities will later be useful when estimating the
critical temperature of the phase transition when the system loses its net
magnetization.
When later implementing these thermodynamical quantities numerically we will
use natural units where $k_B = 1$ and the energy is in units $J$, the
temperature will be unitless $k_BT / J$. Also the magnetization is in
this case a unitless quantity, and due to the energy and temperature scaling the
heat capacity and susceptibility have units $k_B$ and $J^2$ respectively.

\subsection{Analytical Solutions to the $2\times2$ Lattice}\label{subsec:two_by_two_lattice}
Before describing the algorithm modeling the time development of the lattice, we
show the analytical solutions to the mean energy and absolute magnetization as
well as the heat capacity and the susceptibility as shown in \ref{subsec:ising_model}, so as to later enable a
comparison of the numerical results to known analytical quantities. When
counting the energy and magnetization of the $2\times2$ lattice as described in
the previous subsection we get the possible states of the system shown in Table
\ref{tab:possible_energy}. This lattice has in all $2^{N^2} = 2^4 = 16$ possible microstates.

\begin{deluxetable}{cccc}
	%\tablewidth{0pt}
	\tablecaption{Table showing the possible energies $E_i$ and magnetizations $M_i$ of the $2\times2$ lattice and their corresponding number of spins up $N_\uparrow$ and degrees of degeneracy $d_i$. \label{tab:possible_energy}}

	\tablecolumns{4}
	\tablehead{$N_\uparrow$ & $d_i$ & $E_i$ $[J]$ & $M_i$}

	$1$ & $4$ & $0 $& $-2$\\
	$1$ & $1$ & $-8$ &$-4$
	\enddata
\end{deluxetable}
Using the possible energy states in Table \ref{tab:possible_energy} we can write
the partition function of the system as
\begin{align}
	Z = \sum_{i = 1}^{2^{N^2}} e^{\beta E_i} = 4\cosh(8J\beta) + 12.
\end{align}
Using this we get the expectation value for the energy to be
\begin{align}\label{eq:analyticalE}
	\langle E\rangle  = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{i = 1}^{2^{N^2}} E_i e^{-E_i\beta} = -\frac{8J\sinh(8J\beta)}{\cosh(8J\beta) + 3}.
\end{align}
Similarly we find that the expectation value of the absolute magnetization is
given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:analyticalM}
	\langle |M| \rangle = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{i = 1}^{2^{N^2}} |M_i|e^{-E_i\beta} = \frac{2e^{8J\beta} + 4}{\cosh(8J\beta) + 3}.
\end{align}
Next this leads to the heat capacity being
\begin{align}
	C_V = \dv{\langle E \rangle}{T} = -\frac{1}{k_BT^2}\dv{\langle E\rangle}{\beta} = \frac{192(\cosh(8J\beta) + 1)}{k_B T^2(\cosh(8J\beta) + 3)^2},
\end{align}
and the susceptibility (when using the absolute magnetization) is
\begin{align}
	\chi_{|M|} &= \frac{1}{k_BT}\left(\langle M^2 \rangle - \langle |M|\rangle^2 \right) \\
	&= \frac{1}{k_BT}\left(\frac{8e^{8J\beta} + 8}{\cosh(8J\beta) + 3} -\frac{(2e^{8J\beta} + 4)}{(\cosh(8J\beta) + 3)^2} \right).
\end{align}

These analytical quantities can be compares to the numerical results.

\subsection{The MCMC and Metropolis Algorithms}
Now that we have looked at how the lattice of $N\times N$ interacting spins is set up, we
can begin describing the algorithm used to simulate the evolution of the lattice
in time. The algorithm used to simulate the time evolution of the lattice is a
MCMC algorithm. We will, however, only outline the algorithm
used here, which is derived in detail in Ch. 3. and 4. of \cite{newman:2019}.
The main idea behind a Markov Chain is that we want to let the system, in our
case being the lattice of spins, transition from one state $w_i$ to the next state $w_j$
in time. This can be written as
\begin{align}
	w_j = W(i\to j)w_i,
\end{align}
where $W(i\to j)$ is the transition matrix quantifying the probability of
transitioning to $w_j$. If we iterate over many such changes-of-states
the system will converge to the state corresponding to the eigenvector of the
transition probability matrix $W(i\to j)$ having the largest eigenvalue. Since
$W(i\to j)$ is a stochastic matrix, the largest eigenvalue is one. Applying the
matrix to an initial state $w_i$ many times the system thus converges towards equilibrium, effectively losing the time dependence since the change from each
iteration to the next becomes negligable. This means that effectively
\begin{align}
	w(t_i) - w(t_i + \epsilon) = 0,
\end{align}
for a small change $\epsilon$ near the equilibrium position. This can be
rewritten as
\begin{align}
	\sum_i W(i \to j)w_i - W(j \to i)w_j = 0,
	\label{eq:sum_of_states}
\end{align}
simply multiplying out the matrix product of the forward and backward
transitions. There are multiple ways (\ref{eq:sum_of_states}) can be fulfilled,
but we impose detailed balance \citep[Ch. 3. and 4.]{newman:2019} so that each element of the sum
fulfills the equation, making
\begin{align}
	W(j \to i)w_j - W(i \to j)w_i = 0.
\end{align}
Now, because we do not know the transition probabilities $W$ because they are
unknown or too complicated to model, we can use the above relation to model the transition
probability using the Metropolis algorithm \citep[Ch. 3. and 4.]{newman:2019}. From the detailed
balance we get that
\begin{align}
	\frac{w_j}{w_i} = \frac{W(j \to i)}{W(i \to j)} \equiv r.
	\label{eq:trans_prob}
\end{align}
Since the $w$'s are probabilities, the l.h.s. quantifies whether the next state
is more probable than the previous state. Thus if the ratio
$\frac{w_j}{w_i}\geq 1$ we let the system transition to the next state as the
forward transition probability $W(j \to i)$ is larger than the backwards
transition probability $W(i \to j)$. However if the l.h.s. of
(\ref{eq:trans_prob}) is less than one there is a finite probability that the
system may transition forwards or backwards. This must be included in the acceptance rule so as
to not include a bias freezing the system at the state of highest probability,
as we want the system to transition to as many, if not all possible states.

In our case we can rewrite (\ref{eq:trans_prob}) as

\begin{align}
	r \leq \frac{P(E_2)}{P(E_1)} = \frac{\frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta E_2}}{\frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta E_1}} = e^{-\beta\Delta E},
\end{align}
where $r\in[0, 1]$ is a number drawn from a uniform distribution, effectively
modeling all transition possibilities and at the same time eliminate the unknown
partition function $Z$.

When implementing the Markov Chain in practice we first must initialize the
system by computing the $N\times N$ lattice energy and magnetization.
This is simply done by using (\ref{eq:energy}) and (\ref{eq:magnetization}) as
described previously.

We simulate the time evolution by looping through a number of $m$ Monte Carlo
cycles. Then at each Monte Carlo cycle we sweep through the lattice $N\times N$
times to roughly cover the whole grid, by picking a random grid point $i, j$
drawn from a uniform distribution $i,j\in[0, N-1]$ using a Mersenne-Twister
pseudo-random number generator, at each sweep. At each sweep we
suggest a spin flip and compute the energy of the lattice after the flip. Since each spin only has four different nearest neighbors
contributing
to
the energy we find that the change in energy for any suggested flip is among
five possible values $\Delta E \in {-8J, -4J, 0, 4J, 8J}$. Both the change in
energy $\Delta E$ and the change in magnetization $\Delta M$ from a spin flip have analytical
expression;
\begin{align}
	\Delta E &= E_2 - E_1 = -J\sum_{\langle kl\rangle}s_k^2s_l^2 + J\sum_{\langle kl\rangle}s_k^1s_l^1 \\
	&= -J\sum_{\langle kl\rangle}s_k^2(s_l^2-s_l^1) = 2s_l\sum_{\langle k\rangle} s_k,
\end{align}
since the surrounding spins $s_k = s_k^1 = s_k^2$ are unchanged and the fliped
spin $s_l^2 = -s_l^1$. The magnetization change is
\begin{align}
	\Delta M = 2s_l^2,
\end{align}
since the difference in magnetization at a spin flip is 2. This way of
suggesting a new state is more efficient than to compute the energy difference
using a whole new lattice configuration, as it requires a lot less FLOPs.

The difference in energy is than used to determine whether the suggested spin
flip is accepted or not through the described Metropolis algorithm.

For each accepted spin flip the energy and magnetization sample means and variances are
updated. After many cycles the system will then converge to the most likely state
$\langle E\rangle$, and oscillate around it.


\subsection{The Analysis}\label{subsec:analysis}
Now that we have an algorithm computing the described thermodynamic quantites,
we can compare the output to the known analytical values for a $2\times 2$ grid
for an arbitrary temperature $k_BT/J = 1.0$.

The next step is to choose a larger lattice, for instance $N = 20$, both
with an ordered and disordered initial spin configuration. Then we let the
system run through a large number of Monte Carlo cycles, representing a long
time, and computing the sample mean of energy and absolute magnetization as
\begin{align}
	\langle E\rangle &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m E_i\\
	\langle |M|\rangle &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m |M_i|,
\end{align}
at each Monte Carlo cycle $m$. This cumulative mean we can use to find how much
time, i.e. how many Monte Carlo cycles, the system needs to reach a state close
to the most likely state where $\langle E \rangle$ and $\langle |M|\rangle$
start flattening out. This is determined by a by-eye estimate. This is used as a
starting time for the later sampling of energies and magnetization for
the thermodynamical quantites $C_V$ and $\chi$ when looking at the phase
transitions.
Also we plot the number of accepted flips as a function of the Monte Carlo
cycles to see how much the system changes state at any given time step.

To further see if the lattice behaves as expected we can approximate the
Boltzmann distribution $P(E)$ for a given temperature $k_BT/J$ by making a
histogram of the energy states of the system. We would expect that for a low
temperatue like $k_BT / J = 1.0$ that $P(E)$ approaches a $\delta$-function at
small energies as
$\beta$ becomes large, and the exponential function $P(E)$ quickly dies out when
energies become larger. The lattice effectively freezes at the lowest possible
energy state. Therewhile for higher temperatures like $k_BT/J$ the PDF
will look more like a Gaussian distribution as the system has meany more
possible (symmetric) energy states around the equilibrium that it can oscillate
around.

The distributions are than compared to the sample variance given by the central
limit theorem \citep[p. 357]{jensen:2015} defined as
\begin{align}
	\sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2_E}{m},
\end{align}
for the number of experiments (Monte Carlo cycles) $m$ and the energy variance
$\sigma_E^2 = \langle E^2\rangle - \langle E \rangle^2$. This will be an error
estimate of the statistical experiment as it measures the deviation between the
true mean and the sample mean. Also the spread in the histogram is compared to
the standard diviation $\sigma_E$.

Next, we want to study the phase transition where the lattice looses its net
magnetization. In the theory presented in Ch. 5. and 6. \cite{plischke:2006} we see that many
physical properties of the system near the
critical temperature can be described by a power law. Near the critical temperature
$T_C$ for when the lattice undergoes the phase transition, the mean magnetization is
given by
\begin{align}
	\langle M(T) \rangle \sim (T-T_C)^\beta,
\end{align}
where $\beta = 1/8$ is the so-called critical exponent. The heat capacity and
the susceptibility follow analogous relations as
\begin{align}
	C_V(T) &\sim |T_C - T|^{-\alpha} \\
	\chi(T) &\sim |T_C - T|^{-\gamma},
\end{align}
where $\alpha = 0$ and $\gamma = 7.4$. When the lattice is heated to $T \gg T_C$
the correlation length $\xi$ of the lattice becomes of the order of the lattice size.
The correlation length is a measure of how far two correlated spins are
separated. As the temperatue $T$ approaches the critical temperature $T_C$, the
correlation length increases as more and more of the lattice spins are correlated, exerting a divergent behaviour close to $T_C$ as
\begin{align}
	\xi(T) = |T_C - T|^{-\nu},
\end{align}
where we let $\nu = 1$. Since we study a second order phase transition the
correlation length will eventually span the whole system, in our case being
limited to a finite grid this corresponds to the
lattice size $N$. Therefore since
$\xi\propto N$ we get that
\begin{align}
	T_C(N) - T_C(N\to\infty) = aN^{-1/\nu},
	\label{eq:temp_crit}
\end{align}
where $a$ and $\nu$ are constants. Then the mean magnetization becomes 
\begin{align}\label{eq:thermoquantM}
	\langle M(T)\rangle \sim (T - T_C)^\beta \to N^{-\beta/\nu},
\end{align}
the heat capacity becomes 
\begin{align}\label{eq:thermoquantCV}
	C_V(T) \sim |T_C - T|^{-\alpha}\to N^{\alpha / \nu}
\end{align}
and the susceptibility is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:thermoquantchi}
	\chi(T)\sim |T_C - T|^{-\gamma} \to N^{\gamma/\nu},
\end{align}
where we have set $T_C(N) = T$ and $T_C(N\to\infty) = T_C$.
Thus if we plot the mean energy and magnetization as well as the heat capacity
and susceptibility as a function of temperatures we can estimate the critical
temperature for an infinite grid $N\to \infty$. For this we use $N = 40, 60, 80$
and $100$, and a temperature range of $T\in[2.0, 2.5]$ with 50 temperature steps. We expect that the mean energy
and absolute magnetization suddenly bend at $T = T_C(N)$, and that the heat
capacity and susceptibility peak at $T = T_C(N)$. When $N\to\infty$ this peak
will diverge. Using (\ref{eq:temp_crit}) for two grid sizes $N_1$ and $N_2$ we
can estimate the constant $a$ to be
\begin{align}
	a = \frac{T_C(N_1) - T_C(N_2)}{N_1^{-1/\nu} - N_2^{-1/\nu}},
\end{align}
since we know that $T_C(N\to\infty)$ is the same for all grids. Knowing $a$ we
can use (\ref{eq:temp_crit}) to compute an estimate for $T_C(N\to\infty)$. This
estimate can be compared to the analytical value found by \cite{onsager:1944};
$k_BT/J = \frac{2}{\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}\approx 2.269$, for $\nu = 1$.
As looping over several temperatures using a decently large number of Monte
Carlo cycles is very time consuming, we parallelized the temperature loops using
MPI and different compiler flags. To check the speed-up factor we timed code using diffent
degrees of parallelization and compiler flags.


\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
The following results were produced running on an Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU with
a clock speed of 2.60 GHz and 8Gb RAM. The computations were made using C++
using the mpic++ compiler in Ubnutu 16.04.

To determine how many Monte Carlo cycles that were required for the solutions to
stabilize the model was compared to the analytical values for the energy and
the absolute magnetization given by (\ref{eq:analyticalE}) and
(\ref{eq:analyticalM}) respectively for a $2\times 2$ lattice. This shows that the error
became sufficiently small after approximately $10^4$ Monte Carlo cycles.

Using the highest precision found in Table \ref{tab:error} obtained with $10^6$
Monte Carlo cycles, we computed the mean energy and absolute value of the
magnetization as well as the heat capacity and susceptibility for different
temperatures $k_BT/J\in[1.0, 2.12]$. The relative errors to the analytical
solutions described in Section \ref{subsec:two_by_two_lattice} of the computed
quanteties were computed for
the $k_BT/J = 1.0$ case. This is tabulated in Table \ref{tab:2by2_lattice}.

In order to find how long it takes for the model to reach equilibrium we calculate the energy $E$, absolute
magnetization $\vert M \vert$ and heat capacity $C_V$ all as functions of the
temperatue $T$ for lattices with size $N=20$. The values were divided by the
lattice area $N^2$ in order to illustrate these quantities per spin particle. The
number of accepted flips was also counted for these calculations. These results
are shown in Figures \ref{fig:E_MC7}, \ref{fig:M_MC7} and \ref{fig:flip_MC7}
respectively. Here we calculated for two separate temperatures $k_B T/ J = 1.0$
and $k_B T/J=2.4$ with two initial spin configurations. One ordered
configuration where all initial spins point in the same direction and a
disordered configuration where all initial spins are randomly chosen.

The PDF $P(E)$ was plotted as a histogram for the two temperatures. This is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:histogram}. Here we started counting after $5000$ Monte Carlo

the Boltzmann distribution and total variance
according to the central limit theorem $\sigma^2$ for this result are shown in

To study the behavior of the Ising model close to the critical temperature, the
mean energy $\langle E(T) \rangle$, heat capacity $C_V(T)$, magnetic
susceptibility $\chi(T)$ and the mean of the absolute value of the magnetization
$\langle \vert M(T) \vert \rangle$ were calculated in the interval
$k_BT/J\in\lbrack2.0, 2.5\rbrack$. These thermodynamical quantities were plotted
per particle in the given temperature interval using 50 points. This is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:thermo_quants}. For this calculation $10^6$ Monte Carlo cycles
were used for each temperature in the interval. The calculations were done on
four different lattice dimensions $N=40$, $N=60$, $N=80$ and $N=100$ to study
how this affects the solution. The same calculations were also timed using a
varying amount of threads for parallelization and compiler flags for a lattice
with dimensions $N=10$ and $10^6$ Monte Carlo cycles. This is tabulated in Table \ref{tab:timing}.

Finally we used the peaks of the heat capacity $C_V$ of the $N = 80$ and $N =
100$ lattices seen in Figure \ref{fig:thermo_quants}, to estimate the critical
temperature $T_C(N\to\infty)$ of an infinite grid according to the method
described in section \ref{subsec:analysis}. We found that the critical
temperature $k_BT_C / J \approx 2.284$ with a relative error of $\epsilon
\approx 0.675\%$ relative to the analytical value by \cite{onsager:1944}.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
The results in Table \ref{tab:error} and \ref{tab:2by2_lattice} indicate that
the system approaches equilibrium close to the analytical value at $10^4$ Monte
Carlo cycles. At temperature $k_BT/J=1.0$ and $10^6$ Monte Carlo cycles, all
thermodynamical quantities in Table \ref{tab:2by2_lattice} approach the
analytical values within satisfactory relative errors. We see that the
mean energy and absolute magnetization increase and decrease respectively with
increasing temperatures. Both the heat capacity and the magnetic susceptibility
increase within the chosen temperature interval, as they are expected to peak at
the critical temperature and then fall off again.

When studying the mean energy and absolute magnetization for the ordered and
disordered configurations for $N=20$, our results show significant differences
for the four combinations of temperature and initial spin configuration. When
studying the mean energy, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:E_MC7}, one can see
that the ordered configuration for $k_BT/J=1.0$ starts very close to its most
likely state. The disordered configuration with $k_BT/J=1.0$ has an initial
energy with a larger deviation from equilibrium than the ordered configuration,
but it quickly reaches an equilibrium. The same behaviour can be seen for the
same combinations of temperature and initial configuration for the absolute
magnetization as seen in Figure \ref{fig:M_MC7}. The fluctuations around the
most likely state are also relatively small for this temperature. Therefore the
plots of the mean energy and mean absolute magnetization with a disordered
initial configuration seem very smooth. For the temperature $k_BT/J=2.4$, one
can see that for both initial spin configurations the discrepancy between the
most likely state and the initial state is relatively large for both the mean
energy and absolute magnetization. The solution stabilizes around the most
likely state relatively fast, allthough not as fast as for the lower temperature
previously discussed. One can also see that for the higher temperature, the
fluctuations around the most likely state are a lot higher than for $k_BT/J
=1.0$. This can also be seen by studying the number of accepted flips per Monte
Carlo cycle as shown in Figure \ref{fig:flip_MC7}. After the quantities have
stabilized one can see that the number of flips for the higher temperature is a
lot higher than for $k_BT/J=1.0$. While the lower temperature ranges from zero
to four flips, the solution with $k_BT/J=2.4$ ranges from approximately $50$ to
$100$ flips per Monte Carlo cycle. By looking at the figures for the energy and
absolute magnetisation, one can see that the solution stabilizes after
approximately $5000$ Monte Carlo cycles. Therefore this value is used as a
cutoff when computing the thermodynamic quantities used for estimating the
critical temperature, as we are interested in the oscillations around the
equilibrium. By studying the histogram, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:histogram},
one can see that for $k_BT/J=2.4$ the variance in the energy is a lot higher
than for $k_BT/J=1.0$. This is also tabulated in Table \ref{tab:variances}. Here
we can see that for a higher temperature the particles in the crystal has more
permitted energy states around the equilibrium due to the thermal energy causing
larger changes in the configuration of spins compared to crystal of lower
temperature. Since the histogram for $k_BT/J=2.4$ is relatively Gaussian, one can also compare the
standard deviation, given as $\sqrt{\sigma_E^2}$, with the FWHM. Four our result
this seems like a good match using a by-eye estimate. For the lower temperature, the
shape appears too narrow with a small number of bins making it hard to conduct
the same estimation. The shape of the distribution is consistent with
expectation described in section \ref{sec:method}. The variance of the sample mean $\sigma^2$ of the energy
provides an error estimate for the mean of the energy distribution. To improve
our method further, one could include a similar error estimate for the other
results as well.

The implementation of the model was also timed using parallelization and
different compiler flags with $N=10$. This is tabulated in Table
\ref{tab:timing}. Here we can see that there is a significant increase in
efficiency between one and four threads using the compiler flag -O3. However,
the difference between eight and four threads compiled with the -O3 flag is not
that significant. An interesting result is the difference between using eight
threads using the -O1 compiler flag compared to using one thread with the -O3
compiler flag. We found that one thread with the -O3 compiler flag turned out to
be the faster than eight threads with the -O3 compiler flag. This result
indicates that compiler flags have a larger impact on CPU time than
parallelization. However parallelization also provides a significant increase in
performance. Our results however were only produced computing once for every
combination of parallelization and compiler flag. To improve this result and
draw a safer conclusion one should test a wider range of parallelization and
compiler flag combinations and run the calculations more than once to provide a
better statistical analysis.

When computing the thermodynamical quanitites $\langle E(T) \rangle$,  $C_V(T)$,
$\chi(T)$ and $\langle \vert M(T) \vert \rangle$, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:thermo_quants}, our results proved to be in good compliance with theory
as described in section \ref{subsec:analysis}. By looking at the figure one can
see that the heat capacity $C_V(T)$ peaks close to the critical temperature
$T_C$ with a higher peak as the lattice size increases. This is in compliance
with what one would expect from (\ref{eq:thermoquantCV}). The same is the case
for the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility given by
(\ref{eq:thermoquantchi}). The plot for the energy shows that it is not very
sensible to lattice dimensions $N$. It shows a slight bend when the temperature
approaches the $T_C$. The absolute magnetization is, in contrast to the energy,
a lot more sensitive to the lattice dimensions when the temperature approaches
$T_C$. As expected it decreases rapidly after the temperature reaches the
critical temperature. This indicates that the crystal approaches a disordered
state where we have an equal amount of spins in both direction cancelling each
other leading to a loss of magnetization. We found the critical temperature to
in very good agreement with \cite{onsager:1944}.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We have implemented the Ising model to simulate magnetic phase transitions in a
lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Our simulations behave as expected
for the temperatures and initial lattice configurations tested, for $N=20$ with
a sample start after $5000$ Monte Carlo cycles where we can safely assume the
system to close to equilibrium. Our estimated critical temperature of the
studied phase transition $T_C$ aligns well with the results of
\cite{onsager:1944}. 

Further research into the problem would be to see how the system behaves for
more than two temperatures. The problem could also be expanded to three
dimensions in order to reflect a more realistic crystal. In general good
statistical error estimates are missing from most of our results. Including this
could enable a safer ground for conclusions. When performing the timing of the
calculations one could include a larger amount combinations for compiler flags
and degrees of parallelization as well as averaging over several runs giving a
better foundation for conclusions.
